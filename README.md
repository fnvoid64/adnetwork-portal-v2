This is a very old work, in 2013 I created an adnetwork script for a site named adsgem. It was pure functional php and I was learning it that time, that script was used by quite a few people to make mobile adnetwork portals.
Then, I was facinated by the -> thing in a lot of code that I read, so I tried to learn it. Without understanding what OOP is, I just did this one for style :P, like -> means cool dev :P. 
Anyways, very old code from 2014, surprisingly still works :D.
